# data format design
# I will choose JSON format
### Reason for why choose JSON
# 1. Easy to read.
# 2. It's convenient to read JSON in Python which have a JSON library.
# 3. It's easy to modify.
# 4. CSV is easy to use but not suit for complex structure, XML have a clear structure but it is too wordy, 
# YAML is easy to read but not as common as JSON, so the best choice is JSON.
